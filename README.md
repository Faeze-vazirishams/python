In this repository, several problems have been solved using Python, utilizing math operations, conditions, functions, loops, lists and dictionaries methods.
The questions are listed below.
GPA :  A program that takes 5 grades from the user and displays the GPA based on the given format. If any of the input grades are greater than 20, it should display the message "Invalid Grade" and not execute the rest of the program.
Happy number: A program that checks whether the given integer is a happy number or not. A happy number is a number that, if you repeatedly sum the squares of its digits, evevtually leads to 1.
Noemalizer: A program that scales a set of numbers to the range of 0 to 1. 
Polindrome: A program that checks whether the given input string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
Reduction to zero: A program that counts the steps required to reduce an integer to zero. In each step, if the current number is even, divide it by 2, and if it is odd, subtract one from it.
Search in position: A program that takes a sorted list in ascending order and an integer (target) and searches for the given number in the list, returning its index. If the number is not present in the list, it returns the expected index.
Word count: A program that takes a long text and a word from the user and displays the number of times the word is repeated in the text.
